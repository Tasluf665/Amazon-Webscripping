# Amazon-WebScripping-FrontEnd
### This project have two part. First part is the backend-part and the second one is the frontend-part.

This is the sencond part (frontEnd) of this project. First part is https://github.com/Tasluf665/Amazon-WebScripping-Backend here. My recomandation is to, First download and install the backend part. Then download this frontend part.

# Install nodeJs in your pc first.

1. Download this project
2. open it on vs code
3. open vs code terminal. Shortcut (ctrl+`)
4. npm install (Run this command in terminal).
5. npm start (Run this command in terminal).
6. It will show (Would you like to run the app on another port instead? › ) in the terminal.
7. Press enter
8. It will open browser and run the react app in port 3001.

### Always open the backend part first and ensure that backend part always runs on port 3000. And this frontend part runs on 3001. Unless you may see error.
